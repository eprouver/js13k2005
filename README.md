# Celestial Paws

While reading about “Black Cats” I found out they’re not unlucky in Scandinavia.  
In this game, you’re helping put stars into the sky behind the northern lights.

Solve four puzzles by placing one cat next to each glowing charm.  
Then fly through the clouds to collect stars. Successfully solving the puzzles increases the number of stars you can grab.  

The music and puzzles are procedurally generated, so each playthrough is different.  
Some pieces were prototyped as pens. They are in this collection [CodePen collection](https://codepen.io/collection/yyJMMr).

## Rules
- Click empty tiles to place or remove a cat; you can reposition cats until the final cat is placed.  
- Tags show the number of cats in each line.  
- Cats cannot touch, even diagonally.  
- Every charm must orthogonally touch at least one cat.  
- Solve 4 puzzles to start collecting stars for that night.  
- Collect 300 stars to win.  

## Controls
- **Click/tap**: place or remove a cat.  
- **Slider**: steer the cat in the tunnel.
