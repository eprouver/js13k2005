# Celestial Paws

While reading about “Black Cats” I found out they’re not unlucky in Scandinavia.  
In this game, you’re helping put stars into the sky behind the northern lights.

Solve four constraint puzzles by placing at least one cat next to a glowing charm.  
Then fly through a tunnel of clouds to collect stars. Failing a puzzle reduces the number of stars available in the tunnel.  

Music and puzzles are procedurally generated, so each game is different.  
Prototypes of the mechanics can be seen in the [CodePen collection](https://codepen.io/collection/yyJMMr).

## Rules
- Click empty tiles to place or remove a cat; you can reposition all cats until the last cat is placed.  
- Tags show the required number of cats in each line.  
- Cats cannot touch, even diagonally.  
- Every charm must orthogonally touch at least one cat.  
- Solve 4 puzzles to start collecting stars for that night.  
- Collect 300 stars total to win.  

## Controls
- **Click/tap**: place or remove a cat.  
- **Slider**: steer the cat in the tunnel.
