# Celestial Paws

While reading about “Black Cats” I learned they’re not bad luck in Scandinavia.  
In this game, you’re helping them put stars behind the northern lights.

Solve four puzzles by placing one cat next to each glowing charm.  
Then fly through the clouds to collect stars. Successful puzzles increase the number of stars you can grab.  

The music and puzzles are generated, so each playthrough is different.  
Some pieces were started on CodePen. They are in this collection [CodePen collection](https://codepen.io/collection/yyJMMr).

## Rules
- Click empty tiles to place or remove a cat.
- You can reposition cats until the final cat is placed.
- Tags show the number of cats in each line.  
- Cats cannot touch, even diagonally.  
- Every charm must orthogonally touch at least one cat.
- There is no time limit on the puzzles so you can take your time.
- Solve 4 puzzles to start collecting stars for that night.  
- Collect 300 stars to win.  

## Controls
- **Click/tap**: place or remove a cat.  
- **Slider**: steer the cat in the tunnel.
